**Artificial Intelligence Living Entity**

<br/><br/>

**Abstract:**

Use the minima blockchain to build an artificial inteligence capable of learning and solve problems.
If we follow the analogy of how a brain works:
Guessing the minima blockchain will have billions or trillions of nodes:

1. Every node could be a neuron or a group of them.
2. There could be different types of neurons and their propouse and functions would be different according to their type.
3. Every neuron or group of them(a node) should be able to interact with other neurons on the same node or other nodes.
4. The interaction of these neurons betwen them and their different types would generate information that could be related to any events defined, sensors, programming, energy, number of nodes and so on.......
5. This information would generate kwnowledge.
6. This knowledge could be used as group of datasets to training the artificial brain and to build a model where this "Entity" could react to events, sensors, programming or whatever functions it is trained and programed to do.
7. Learning machine, classification, custer and regresion algortihms should be developed to let the neurons(groups of nodes) to work on specific problems or even to get some kind of concience that maybe it could act and think for its own.


**Requirements:**

Minima nodes
A decentralized Dapp on every node that would act as a neuron or group of them working on what they have been programmed, it can be a fixed program or it can be a dynamic programmable.
Artificial Inteligence algorihtism that it let act the whole decentralize system act as a learning machine, build datasets according what is programmed and the sensors on every node or external data inputs, use part of those datasets to train the machine learning on the problems for which is trained.

**Product Market:**

Having a system that can be programmed on a given parameters to automatically learn from certain inputs it opens a huge market for almost everything.
- Vheicle to Vehicle comunication and autodriving.
- Bots for trading on the markets 
- Drones to be trained to autosearch for problems on cities, traffic, agriculture......
- Act according millions or billions of sensors of any type spared all over the world, cities, field, factories, space to learn or detect and prevent threats, or problems before they even happen.
- Guide blind people over the citties warning them or giving them isnstructions of the path to follow to avoid obstacles.

**Beneficits:**
The system can be tokenize, several tokens can be used depending on the goals:
- A company want to train a system, they have to bought Machine Learning tokens.
- A company wants to test a data set against an already build working model, they have to bought Machine Data set tokens.
- Any user that have a Dapp installed thar forms part of the system it receive tokens , AI tokens that are need to run the other systems as a kind of a gas.
- and so on......

**-How this could be built over minima ?**
-Every Node should have a DAPP that would form part of the system
-It could be several types of Dapps:
-1. A Dapp to act as a neuron or group of them generating information of their interactuation.
-2. A Dapp to program a hive of nodes to teach to do things according to some programmings.
-3. A Dapp to test a group of data sets over a built models that already been teached.
-4. A kind of shop to select a group of Artificial Inteligence DAPPS to do certain task.
....and so on.

**Any node of minima is a mini webserver.**
Any dapp on minima it is a web page that has its own sql database that can save information collected.
Instead of saving the information collected this can be hashed and saved on the blockchain embedded on a token assuring the integrity on the collected data and the saved data, at the same time, this data collected can be upload on background to someking of saving cloud server.
The interaction with the differents nodes can be done sending between them tokens(any kind of neuron could be a different token) that can contain data in their state variables, or over maxima.


This is only a general overview and introductio that has to be more developed and analised for Jordi that is the expert on Artificial Inteligence of the group and decide if can be possible to build such a system or not since the point of view of AI.
